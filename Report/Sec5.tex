The analysis demonstrated has been successful to simulate the Penrose process. Further applications would be to investigate more into the limits of the process in terms of its efficiency. An even more interesting extension would be to add a non-zero electrical charge on the particles. Then, there will be an additional Lorentz force that actually favors the Penrose process (\cite{PenroseProcessCharged}). Simulation of this generalized Penrose process could shine more light on the natural mechanisms allowing a physical black hole to appear energetic to a distant observer.

Eventually, we would like to also simulate the Blandford-Znajek process (\cite{Blandford1977}) which is believed to be the main mechanism explaining the incredible power emitted by quasars but for now, we submit the process so far.
